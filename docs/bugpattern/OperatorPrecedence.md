The [Google Java Style Guide ยง4.7][style] states:

Use grouping parentheses to disambiguate expressions that could be
misinterpreted.

For example, consider this:

```java
boolean d = (a && b) || c;
boolean e = (a || b) ? c : d;
int z = (x + y) << 2;
```

Instead of this:

```java
boolean d = a && b || c;
boolean e = a || b ? c : d;
int z = x + y << 2;
```

Using [text blocks] for strings that span multiple lines can make code easier to
read.

For example, prefer this:

```java
String message =
    """
    'The time has come,' the Walrus said,
    'To talk of many things:
    Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing-wax --
    Of cabbages -- and kings --
    And why the sea is boiling hot --
    And whether pigs have wings.'
    """;
```

instead of this:

```java
String message =
    "'The time has come,' the Walrus said,\n"
        + "'To talk of many things:\n"
        + "Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing-wax --\n"
        + "Of cabbages -- and kings --\n"
        + "And why the sea is boiling hot --\n"
        + "And whether pigs have wings.'\n";
```

## Trailing newlines

If the string should not contain a trailing newline, use a '\' to escape the
final newline in the text block. That is, these two strings are equivalent:

```java
String s = "hello\n" + "world";
```

```java
String s =
    """
    hello
    world\
    """;
```

The suggested fixes for this check preserve the exact contents of the original
string, so if the original string doesn't include a trailing newline the fix
will use a '\' to escape the last newline.

If the whitespace in the string isn't significant, for example because the
string value will be parsed by a parser that doesn't care about the trailing
newlines, consider removing the final '\' to improve the readability of the
string.

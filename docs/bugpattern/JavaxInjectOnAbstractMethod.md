The [`Inject`] annotation cannot be applied to abstract methods, per the JSR-330
spec, since injectors will only inject those methods if the concrete implementer
of the abstract method has the [`Inject`] annotation as well. See
[OverridesJavaxInjectableMethod] for more examples of this interaction.

Currently, default methods in interfaces are not injected if they have
[`Inject`] for similar reasons, although future updates to dependency injection
frameworks may allow this, since the default methods are not abstract.

See the [Guice wiki] page on JSR-330 for more.
